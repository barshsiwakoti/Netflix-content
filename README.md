# Netflix-content-analysis

This project involved some data refinement in Excel, including text parsing, formatting, error identification, and removal of duplicates for Netflix's content analysis. Using Tableau, I created a comprehensive and interactive dashboard, revealing significant insights: Netflix offers more movies than TV shows, primarily produced in the US, India, and the UK. Movie production peaked in 2017-2018 but has since declined, now favoring TV show creation. Dominant genres encompass drama, comedy, action & adventure. These insights fostered informed decision-making, unveiling evolving content trends critical for strategic planning within Netflix's content strategy landscape. 

Picture of the dashboard is included below:
