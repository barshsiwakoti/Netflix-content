# Netflix-content-analysis

For this project, I cleaned up the data in Excel, which included text parsing, formatting, error identification, and removal of duplicates for Netflix's content analysis. Using Tableau, I created a comprehensive and interactive dashboard, revealing significant insights: Netflix offers more movies than TV shows, primarily produced in the US, India, and the UK. Movie production peaked in 2017-2018 but has since declined, now favoring TV show creation. Most popular genres includes drama, comedy, action & adventure.

Here is a picture of the dashboard for convenience:
